## Property Details

<a id="address-property"></a>

### address

The CombineTier address of this class that the simulation is done for. this is needed for THIS\_ADDRESS opcode and updating storage types after method calls, and needs to be a string number or hex string.

*Overrides [vmSimulation.address](./vmsimulation.md#address-property)*

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
address: string;
```

<a id="report-property"></a>

### report

The report of each account which is compatible and can be stored in

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
report: sStore;
```

## Method Details

<a id="setReport-method-1"></a>

### setReport(account, timestamp, blockNumber)

Method to get the report for an account which then will be stored in the class's report property and can be accessed later on, each time this method is called it runs the JSVM for the scripts and updates the report of the account it is been called for

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
setReport(account: string, timestamp?: number, blockNumber?: number): Promise<string>;
```

#### Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  account | `string` | the account to get and update the report for which needs to be string number or hex string |
|  timestamp | `number` | (optional) custom timestamp to be used when running the script |
|  blockNumber | `number` | (optional) custom block number to be used when running the script |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<string>`

the report of the account in a 64 char length hex string
