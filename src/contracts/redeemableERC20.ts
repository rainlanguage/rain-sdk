/**
 * @public
 * A class for calling methods on a RedeemableERC20.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This class provides an easy way to interact with RedeemableERC20 contracts.
 *
 * An RedeemableERC20 is the ERC20 token that is minted and distributed in the ISale contract.
 *
 * During `Phase.ZERO` the token can be traded and so compatible with the Balancer pool mechanics.
 * During `Phase.ONE` the token is frozen and no longer able to be traded on any AMM or transferred
 * directly.
 *
 * The token can be redeemed during `Phase.ONE` which burns the token in exchange for pro-rata erc20
 * tokens held by the `RedeemableERC20` contract itself.
 *
 * The token balances can be used indirectly for other claims, promotions and events as a proof of
 * participation in the original distribution by token holders.
 *
 * The token can optionally be restricted by the `ITier` contract to only allow receipients with a
 * specified membership status.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { RedeemableERC20 } from 'rain-sdk';
 *
 * // To get a instance of an already deployed redeemable, pass the contract address and an ethers.js Signer
 * const redeemable = new RedeemableERC20(address, signer);
 *
 * // Check if an address is child from the factory deployed in the current chain.
 * await RedeemableERC20.isChild(signer, maybeChildAddress);
 *```
