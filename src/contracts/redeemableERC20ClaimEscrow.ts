/**
 * @public
 * A class for calling methods on a RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This class provides an easy way to interact with the Escrow Rain
 *
 * An Escrow contract for ERC20 tokens to be deposited and withdrawn against
 * redeemableERC20 tokens from a specific `Sale`.
 *
 * When some token is deposited the running total of that token against the
 * trust is incremented by the deposited amount. When some `redeemableERC20`
 * token holder calls `withdraw` they are sent the full balance they have not
 * previously claimed, multiplied by their fraction of the redeemable token
 * supply that they currently hold. As redeemable tokens are frozen after
 * distribution there are no issues with holders manipulating withdrawals by
 * transferring tokens to claim multiple times.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow } from 'rain-sdk'
 *
 * // If the escrow address is unkwon or want to simplify the process, use get() to create the instance.
 * // This use the provider inside the signer to get the chainId and search the correct address.
 * const escrow = RedeemableERC20ClaimEscrow(saleAddress, tokenAddress, ethersSigner);
 *
 * const tx = escrow.deposit(amount);
 * ```
