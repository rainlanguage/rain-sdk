 *
 * Trust-minimised contract to record the state of some verification process. When some off-chain
 * identity is to be reified on chain there is inherently some multi-party, multi-faceted trust
 * relationship. For example, the DID (Decentralized Identifiers) specification from W3C outlines
 * that the controller and the subject of an identity are two different entities.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Verify } from 'rain-sdk'
 *
 * // To deploy a new Verify, pass an ethers.js Signer, the chainId and the config for the Verify.
 * const newVerify = await Verify.deploy(signer, chainId, VerifyConfigArgs)
 *
 * // To connect to an existing Verify just pass the address and an ethers.js Signer.
 * const existingVerify = new Verify(address, signer)
 *
 * // Once you have a Verify, you can call the smart contract methods:
 * ```
